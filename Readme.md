Standalone autotest extracted from ZenTest.  

As soon as you save a file, autotest will run the matching tests.

Improvements over ZenTest
=========================
 - `-c` not run all tests after a failed test passes
 - `-r` use given config file
 - `-p` use parallel_tests to run tests (Test::Unit only)
 - `-s` use any style you want -> `alias autospec2="autotest --style rspec2"`
 - `-b` use bundle exec to run tests
 - `-n` notify about results (simple + experimental)
 - simplified test setup
 - simplified packaging
 - less globals
 - integration tests

Install
=======
    sudo gem uninstall ZenTest
    sudo gem install autotest-standalone

Optional: [Autotest for Test::Unit on Rails](https://github.com/grosser/autotest-rails)
    sudo gem install autotest-rails-pure
Optional: [ZenTest without Autotest](http://github.com/grosser/zentest) version:
    sudo gem install zentest-without-autotest


Usage
=====
 - go to project folder with tests
 - run `autotest`

### Options
    -f, --fast-start                 Do not run full tests at start
    -p, --parallel                   Run tests (Test::Unit only) in parallel -- gem install parallel_tests
    -c, --no-full-after-failed       Do not run full tests after failed test passed
    -v, --verbose                    Be verbose. Prints files that autotest doesn't know how to map to tests
    -q, --quiet                      Be quiet.
    -r, --rc CONFIG                  Path to config file. (Defaults to ~/.autotest or current_dir/.autotest)
    -s, --style STYLE                Which style to use, e.g. rspec, rspec2
    -b, --bundle-exec                Use bundle exec to run tests
    -n, --notify                     Notify about success and failure via popups
    -h, --help                       Show this.

Windows needs [diff.exe](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html)

TIPS
====
 - [RSpec] if you want to use `require 'spec_helper'` -> `rspec --configure autotest`

TODO
====
 - add documentation for hooks
 - remove globals from unitdiff
 - add some automatic notifications e.g. autotest -n -> use any notify library found
 - use watchr
